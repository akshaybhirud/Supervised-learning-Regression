ALL IN ONE REGRESSION CHEAT SHEET
---------------------------------
* 3 X predictors - wt, disp, hp . Y value - mpg
STEP 1 - CHECK FOR EXTENT OF CORRELATION
* Run Prediction model. Add x var one by one, keep checking Adj R square
* Check when Adj r square is highest, with that x combination
* wt has highest influence on mpg, with high m value (-3.8009)
* disp has least influence on mpg, with low m value (-0.0009)
* disp is a good candidate for elimination from the model

STEP 2 - CHECK FOR OUTLIERS
* Outliers are values farther than 1.5 times the IQR.
* Another method - Calculate outliers for each x parameter using studentised residuals
* If studentized residuals > 3 that x is an outlier with high leverage.
* Remove those x values

STEP 3 - CHECK FOR MULTI-COLLINEARITY
* Find corr-coef between x1 <> x2, x1 <> x3 , x2 <> x3
* Calculate VIF for each x
* If VIF > 5, to be removed or modified
* Calculate VIF after dropping. Repeat until free of multi-collinearity

STEP 4 - RESIDUAL ERROR MUST BE NORMALLY DISTRIBUTED
* We use Shapiro Wilk test  from scipy library.
* Find p-value for NULL HYPOTHESIS (Yes, normally distributed)
* If p-value > 0.05, accept null hypotehsis
* Cross check using Probability plot. Here the residuals will be represented as dots (in blue) should fall on the red line.

STEP 5 - CHECK FOR AUTO-CORRELATION
* Test can be skipped when there is no time stamp in the data
* Check for absence of autocorrelation using Ljungbox test
* Null Hypothesis: Autocorrelation is absent.
